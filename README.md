# Concentration - Memory Game Project
This game is a browser based card matching game also known as Concentration. It is built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is developed as a part of Udacity's Front End Development Nanodegree program. The skeleton code with the static HTML and CSS code is available at [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game)

## How the game works
  - The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid.
  - The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.
  - The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.
  - The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
  - Each turn will have the following steps:
    - The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
    - The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
    - If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
    - If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
  - The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
